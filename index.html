  <h1>The Spiny Sea Urchin</h1>
  <p>Sea urchins or urchins, archaically called sea hedgehogs, are spiny, globular animals in the class <i class="taxonomy">Echinoidea</i>. About 950 species of echinoidid inhabit all oceans from the intertidal to 5,000 metres (16,000 ft; 2,700 fathoms) deep. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(biology)">Tests</a> (the hard shells) of sea urchins are round and spiny, typically from 3 to 10 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr> (1.2 to 3.9 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>) across. Common colors include black and dull shades of green, olive, brown, purple, blue, and red. Sea urchins move slowly, feeding primarily on algae. Sea otters, starfish, wolf eels, triggerfish, and other predators hunt and feed on sea urchins. The name "urchin" is an old word for hedgehog, which sea urchins resemble.</p>
  <p>Sea urchins are members of the phylum <i class="taxonomy">Echinodermata</i>, which also includes sea stars, sea cucumbers, brittle stars, and crinoids. Like other echinoderms, they have five-fold symmetry (called pentamerism) and move by means of hundreds of tiny, transparent, adhesive "tube feet". The symmetry is not obvious in the living animal, but is easily visible in the dried test.</p>
